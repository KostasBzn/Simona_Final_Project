### **Simona Final Project [Beta version]**

- **Our story:**

Behind the screen a seed was thrown,

As time passed, the seed of our minds pulled started to grow individually by each character,
and with each next meeting a specifi number arose to gather. Number 10 was our shade under
the tree we planted together.

The breakout rooms of Zoom were the ones that would always promt us to play- Time was at
our disposal. Gathering the room number 10 was our safe heaven, our sacial place and the
scree became less lonely. We always knew w wanted to work together in ourfinal gathering.

A song,
A place,
And out laughter, made an idea which once again strechedour fruits of our labor and became
Simona.

We will miss our times, butthe ree we planted will always remain,
Here, in the space of bits and bytes.
